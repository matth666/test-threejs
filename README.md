# TEST THREE.JS

Just a litle exercise to test Three.js.

## Solar System

I draw the solar system as first exercise, not really at scale of course...
It contains a star (the sun), 9 planets (I put back Pluton as a planet) and their respectives moons if exist.

## Run the system

In the console, at good directory (test-threejs)

```
npm install // to install deps
npx vite // to launch on localhost:5173
```

Vite is a launcher, used in the tutorial, so I used it too.
